<p>I have been involved with cryptocurrencies since 2016 and it has been a fantastic ride! When I got involved, Bitcoin was less than $1000 (NZD) and then within ten months, had gone up to about 30K. I was hooked. I wasn't just hooked on the excitement, but on the principles of cryptocurrencies, including decentralisation and privacy. I will talk about those on this site.</p>

<p>Other things? I have a Master of Business Administration and a Master of Education. I love business and I love teaching, so this site brings together those things. I also have a Master of Counselling and care about the well-being of others. I hope to also discuss the potential for cryptocurrencies to help others in their lives, including the relative lower anxieties that financial independence can bring.</p>

<p>It is important to me to also give something back to the community, so you will find some posts related to mental health and meditation. I love art, so some of that might be seen here, too.</p>
