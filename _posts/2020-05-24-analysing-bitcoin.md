<h2>Data Science and Bitcoin</h2>

<p>So, you are interested in data science and cryptocurrencies. You imagine that there must be some way to see how cultural trends may influence the price and/or popularity of your favourite coin(s), but you aren't sure where to begin to compare trends with prices. This article has been written for you. This article also for you if you want to get some idea of following trends, but don't intend to do data science yourself.</p>

<h2>First things</h2>

<p>You cannot determine a casual relationship between most events and cryptocurrency prices. If you are looking for absolute answers (or investment advice), you are not going to find what you seek. Investors look at wide trends and then use their intuition (life experiences) to make hunches - yes, hunches - for investing. If there were simple formulae and answers, then everyone would be rich (but then, if we were all "rich", no one would be). Best not to go down the path of philosophical considerations, here. Suffice it to say that there are no ANSWERS, but by looking at some figures and events, we are going to see how data science might be applied in a simple way to cryptocurrencies.</p>

<h2>Cryptocurrency Question</h2>

<p><i>Do moments of political instability generally increase Bitcoin prices?</i><p> 

<p>This question is too broad to be useful, so how can we limit the concept of "political instability" to something meaningful? Once we define instability, we will need to figure out how to get Bitcoin prices, but let's start with defining "instability".</p>
