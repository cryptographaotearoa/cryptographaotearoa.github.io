<h2>Data Science Examples</h2>

<p>I will be using a few programs to illustrate data science principles on this site. Two of the major programs for data science calculations and data visualisations at the moment are RStudio (based on the R Programming Language) and Jupyter Notebooks (based on the Python Programming Language). Jupyter Notebooks (as I will use them here) are based on Python.<p> 

<p>If I am discussing something related to data science or cryptocurrencies and I want to just show a graph, I might paste it into an article on this site as a image. If I want to do something more complex, such as include calculations and other code, I will most often include a Jupyter Notebook link.</p>

<h2>Jupyter Notebooks</h2>

<p>What is a Jupyter Notebook?</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The Jupyter Notebook is an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text. Uses include: data cleaning and transformation, numerical simulation, statistical modeling, data visualization, machine learning, and much more.</p>

<p>These notebooks include text - the normally formatted stuff, like what you are reading now. They also contain code that can be run from within the notebook (not within the images uploaded to this site though, obviously), and they often contain graphics/charts generated from the code, as seen in the sample screenshot below.</p>

<p>So, when I reference a Jupyter Notebook in an article, you might see an image, as the one immediately above, you might see a link to Google Colaboratory (for those who have a Google account and who want to go through the notebook themselves) and/or you might see the notebook code linked to on my Github account.<p>

<p>Which of these I use will depend on what I am trying to accomplish, but I have created this post so that you will know about bit about Jupyter Notebooks when you see them on this site.</p>
