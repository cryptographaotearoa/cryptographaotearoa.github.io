<h2>Data Science Examples</h2>

<p>A few programs to illustrate data science principles will be used on this site. Two of the major programs for data science calculations and data visualisations at the moment are <a href="https://rstudio.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="RStudio">RStudio</a> (based on the <a href="https://www.r-project.org/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="R Programming Language">R Programming Language</a>) and <a href="https://jupyter.org/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Jupyter Notebooks">Jupyter Notebooks</a> (based on the <a href="https://www.python.org/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Python Programming Language">Python Programming Language</a>). Jupyter Notebooks as used here utilise Python.<p> 

<p>If a graph is all that is required in an article, an image of the graph might be significant. If something complex is being discussed that you might want to work through yourself (or confirm the results), a link to a Jupyter Notebook or the Python code on the Cryptograph Ltd Github site might be provided.</p>

<h2>Jupyter Notebooks</h2>

<p>What is a Jupyter Notebook?</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The Jupyter Notebook is an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text. Uses include: data cleaning and transformation, numerical simulation, statistical modeling, data visualization, machine learning, and much more.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>These notebooks include text - the normally formatted stuff, like what you are reading now. They also contain code that can be run from within the notebook (not within the images uploaded to this site though, obviously), and they often contain graphics (data visualisations) generated from the code, as seen in the sample screenshot below.</p>

<p>So, when an article references a Jupyter Notebook, you might see an image, as the one immediately above, you might see a link to <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Google Colab">Google Colaboratory</a> (for those who have a Google account and who want to go through the notebook themselves) and/or you might see the notebook code linked to on my Github account.<p>

<p>Which of these are provided will depend on the focus of the article. This brief introduction to Jupyter Notebooks has been provided so that you will know about bit about Jupyter Notebooks when you see them on this site.</p>
